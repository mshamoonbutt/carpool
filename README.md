## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Mapbox API key (free tier available)
- OpenAI API key (optional, for AI features)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd unipool
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment setup**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your API keys to `.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

4. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Open in browser**
```
http://localhost:5174
```

## üß™ Testing

### **Multi-User Testing**
Since we're using localStorage (shared across tabs), you can simulate multi-user functionality:

1. **Open multiple browser tabs**
2. **Login as different users in each tab**
3. **Post rides in one tab, book in another**
4. **Watch real-time updates across tabs**

### **Test Users**
```
Student1: student1@fccu.edu.pk (password: password123)
Student2: student2@fccu.edu.pk (password: password123)
```

### **Demo Scenarios**
1. **Driver posts ride** ‚Üí Appears in real-time
2. **Rider searches and books** ‚Üí Seat count updates
3. **Real-time sync** ‚Üí Updates across all tabs
4. **Rating system** ‚Üí After ride completion
